# LSQRwithEigen

## Motivation
LSQR[1] is an algorithm for solving linear system Ax=b in least-square sense. LSQR is similar to, but is more robust on ill-conditioned problems (the condition number of A is large) than Conjugate Gradient method. Although I found several implementaions of LSQR, I want a LSQR library that can deal with matrix A and vector b defined with [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php).

## Requirement
Source code of Eigen 3 
( See the webpage of [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php). )

## How to use it

1. Put the source code of Eigen 3 to the same directory as *LSQR.cpp*, *LSQr.h*, and *example.cpp*.
2. In order to solve the linear system Ax =b, write the following code (See also *example.cpp*):

  ```
    LSQR lsqr =	LSQR(A, b, x, 1.0e-8);
  ```
  where A, b and x must be SparseMatrix<double>, VectorXd and VectorXd of Eigen. LSQR starts to solve the problem using given *x* as the initial solution. **So please note that *x* must be initialized before solving**. If you can guess *x* by the other ways, you can input the guess to *x*. Otherwise, *x* is initialized as a zero vector in general.
  
3. We can get the solution by LSQR with:

  ```
    x =	lsqr.SolutionX();
  ```
